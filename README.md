# Zuhlke Spring Framework Demos - Spring Boot

## Description

This Java project builds upon the Spring concepts presented in repositories:
https://github.com/VladTChiriacescu/spring-framework-project1 and
https://github.com/VladTChiriacescu/spring-framework-project2

It contains:
1. 2 REST controllers built using Spring Boot 3.
2. A Spring configuration component that showcases the automatic matching that
Spring Boot can do between a configuration class and application properties stored in application.properties file.
(ie. a configuration bean is instantiated by the framework with the field values provided in this properties file).

## Note

This project has been built while following the Udemy Masterclass on Spring Framework
and Spring Boot 3 (this project is not a git clone of the Masterclass sources).
